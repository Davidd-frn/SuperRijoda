            <p><strong>Super Rijoda</strong> is a 2D platformer inspired by classic games like <strong>Super Mario Bros</strong> and <strong>Rayman</strong>.  
            The player controls Rijoda, a small hero who must travel through challenging levels filled with enemies, obstacles, and hidden power-ups to save his world.</p>

            <p>The game focuses on a simple and accessible gameplay style, enhanced by our own unique mechanics and retro visuals.</p>

            <p>The main features of the game include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Character Control:</strong> The player moves through the level using classic platforming controls — jumping, running, and collecting transformation power-ups that grant temporary abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Level Progression:</strong> The game includes a series of levels with increasing difficulty, new environments, and enemies. Each level is handcrafted to provide unique challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Enemies:</strong> Enemies appear throughout the game and try to block the player’s path. Some chase the player, while others present platforming challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Health System:</strong> The health system is inspired by Mario. The player starts with a basic transformation. If hit while transformed, they revert to the basic form. If hit in the basic form, they lose a life. This makes collecting and keeping transformations a key part of survival.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All these features come together to offer a fun, nostalgic, and engaging experience that blends the best of old-school platformers with a modern twist.</p>

            <p><strong>Super Rijoda</strong> is developed as part of the Web Development course at HES-SO Valais, and it pays tribute to the golden era of pixel-art games while introducing new ideas and gameplay variety.</p>

            <p>You can find the project's source code and follow our progress on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>
